========================
Do you know enough about the Kendall Rank Correlation? â€” Hopefully, this will add on to what you know. Here's a link to a [medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/kendall-rank-correlation-explained-dee01d99c535) where I explain Kendal Rank Correlation in depth 
This is a very exciting item for me to touch on especially because it helps to uncover complex and unknown relationships between the variables in your data set which you canâ€™t tell just by looking at the data.

++ This saves a lot of time. Hurray! ðŸ™Œ
